Final-Project

make roguelike game
Top-down tile-based turn-based RPG with randomly generated maps and perma-death.
The player will be able to obtain magical skills through finding tomes on the ground and reading them.
The goal is to find the stairs to go down the dungeon to find the treasure and then to escape.

Version 1 (Post Winter Break)- Will generate and display the map (generator creates cave-like maps). The player can move around their character ('@') around the map and can attack monsters on the map.

History:
Created map and allowed for player to move
set rules for places where the player can move
started algorithm for cave-like structure of the map
made the algorithm cleaner
fixed the algorithm by making the edges of the screen to be walls 
shifted map so you can see the whole cave
player and monster spawn is randomized
can attack monsters
ladder is generated ( with no function ) player and monster spawn all moved within map generation

To-Do List:
Add line of sight.
Add Monster AI. Also, they should drop loot on death.
Find a theme.
Add equipment (weapons,armor,etc.).
Add prefixes/suffixes, enchantments or whatever to the items (basically give them random stats/effects)
Maybe add consumables
Stats?
Leveling up (both character's level and going up the dungeon)
Scaling loot/monsters to go up with dungeon? (can hard-code it)
